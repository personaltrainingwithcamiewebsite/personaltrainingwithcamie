    <p><b>Experience: </b>13 years</p>

    <p><b>Certification: </b>Pain free Performance Specialist from PPSC, Personal Trainer cerfication from ACE, and Orthopedic Exercise Spcialist Program from ACE</p>
    <p><b>Bio:</b></p>
    <p>
      Camie Morisset has been instructing fitness since 2012. She fell in love with personal training after experiencing profound growth and change with the help of a personal trainer. Camie already had two degrees from the University of Washington when she earned her certification with the American Council on Exercise and a specialty certification in Orthopedic Exercise. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently, Camie serves clients ranging from 9 to 80+ years old at Muscle Farmer Fitness Studios in Bellevue. She trains athletes of all kinds, including runners, swimmers, rock climbers and cyclists. She trains young people who take their athletic endeavors seriously and middle-aged folks who want to stay strong and mobile longer. She has a special fondness for training elders who want to regain lost strength, mobility, and, as a result, independence. She specializes in working with new and long-time prosthetics, including replaced knees and hips. She also has experience with recent bariatric patients as well as those living with or recovering from cancer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Camie uses functional strength and mobility training to help you maintain independence as you age. She wants you to be able to keep lifting your luggage into the overhead bin. Building strength looks different for everyone, and helping you build it safely and sustainably is Camie’s number one priority. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Camie tailors her workouts to suit the strength and mobility of each of her clients, even as they vary by session. She believes in healing your problem areas before she strengthens your areas of weakness, and she is especially passionate about good posture. She emphasizes nutrition and cleaning eating that is realistic and sustainable, and she doesn’t push fad diets or trends. She focuses on science and your personal needs. 
    </p> 
    <p>
      When Camie isn’t training a client or studying up on the latest in health science, she’s on a 100-mile bike ride or the golf course. She also loves hiking, lifting weights, and cheering for her daughter on the basketball court.
